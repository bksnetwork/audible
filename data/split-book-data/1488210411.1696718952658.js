window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“At last, the feminist history of booze we’ve been waiting for!” (Amy Stewart, author of </b><b><i>The Drunken Botanist</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>From</b> <b><i>Los Angeles Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Mallory O’Meara comes a lively and engrossing feminist history of women drinking through the ages.</b></p> <p>Strawberry daiquiris. Skinny martinis. Vodka sodas with lime. These are the cocktails that come in sleek-stemmed glasses, bright colors, and fruity flavors - these are the girly drinks.</p> <p>From the earliest days of civilization, alcohol has been at the center of social rituals and cultures worldwide. But when exactly did drinking become a gendered act? And why have bars long been considered “places for men” when, without women, they might not even exist?</p> <p>With whip-smart insight and boundless curiosity, <i>Girly Drinks</i> unveils an entire untold history of the female distillers, drinkers, and brewers who have played a vital role in the creation and consumption of alcohol, from ancient Sumerian beer goddess Ninkasi to iconic 1920s bartender Ada Coleman. Filling a crucial gap in culinary history, O’Meara dismantles the long-standing patriarchal traditions at the heart of these very drinking cultures, in the hope that listeners everywhere can look to each celebrated woman in this book - and proudly have what she’s having.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A thrilling novelization that will take listeners inside the story of Walt Disney Studios’ live action Cruella film.</b></p> <p><b><i>De Vil by design...</i></b></p> <p>Estella is a clever and creative grifter determined to make a name for herself with her designs amid the 1970s London punk-rock revolution. As a girl, Estella befriended a pair of young thieves with an appetite for mischief, and together the trio has been able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. But Estella longs for more than an existence built on stealing to make ends meet.</p> <p>One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness Von Hellman, a design legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute. But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable, and revenge-bent Cruella.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Born to a death sentence in a near-future America, rebellious sisters herald a revolution - if they can survive. </b></p> <p>Twins Ava and Mira Goodwin defy the Rule of One simply by existing. The single-child law, ruthlessly enforced by Texas’s Governor Roth, has made the sisters famous fugitives and inspirations for the resurgent rebellion known as the Common.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the relentless governor and his implacable Texas State Guard threaten that fragile hope, as Roth consolidates his power in a bid for ultimate authority.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Ava and Mira relinquish the relative safety of their Canadian haven to stand against Roth, new allies arise: Owen, a gifted young programmer, impulsively abandons his comfortable life in a moment of compassion, while Zee, an abused labor camp escapee, finds new purpose in resistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>The four will converge on Dallas for a reckoning with Roth, with nothing less than their destinies - and the promise of a future free from oppression - on the line.&nbsp;</p> <p>Disobedience means death. But a life worth living demands rebellion.</p>";

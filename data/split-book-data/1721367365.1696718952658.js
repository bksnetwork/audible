Black-market blood sport is the perfect self-imposed penance. But when she stumbles on a plot to overthrow the corporate empire that provides the ubiquitous global feed, Emily discovers her old friends have been targeted. Warning them will force her out into the open, back on-grid, and directly into danger. Emily can’t escape the past. But can she seize the future?&nbsp;</p> <p>Emily’s quest for redemption spirals into an all-out shadow war. What constitutes justice in a world run by algorithms? The feed - and Emily - must be reinvented. Or destroyed.</p>";

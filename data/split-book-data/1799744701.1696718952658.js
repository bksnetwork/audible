window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Don Quixote, a man driven by chivalrous ideals and wild delusions, adopts sword and lance as a knight-errant to defend the weak, slay the ignoble, and win the heart of the farm girl he envisions as a princess. In his world of fantasy - where inns are castles, peasants are kings, and windmills are beasts - Quixote, his nag, and his sound but devoted squire, Sancho Panza, set forth on a picaresque adventure conceivable only to a man obsessed.</p> <p>One part legendary quest, one part metareflection of that very legend, <i>Don Quixote</i> remains, after four centuries, one of the most radical, profound, playful, and heartbreaking epics ever dreamed.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>Don Quixote</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>Don Quixote (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";

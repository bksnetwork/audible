window.bookSummaryJSON = "Is a loved one missing some body parts? Are blondes becoming extinct? Is everyone at your dinner table of the same species? Humans and chimpanzees differ in only 400 genes; is that why an adult human being resembles a chimp fetus? And should that worry us? There's a new genetic cure for drug addiction - is it worse than the disease? <p>We live in a time of momentous scientific leaps; a time when it's possible to sell our eggs and sperm online for thousands of dollars or test our spouses for genetic maladies. We live in a time when one fifth of all our genes are owned by someone else, and an unsuspecting person and his family can be pursued cross-country because they happen to have certain valuable genes within their chromosomes.</p> <p>Devilishly clever, <i>Next</i> blends fact and fiction into a breathless tale of a new world where nothing is what it seems, and a set of new possibilities can open at every turn. <i>Next</i> challenges our sense of reality and notions of morality. Balancing the comic and bizarre with the genuinely frightening and disturbing, <i>Next</i> shatters our assumptions and reveals shocking new choices where we least expect.</p> <p>The future is closer than you think. Get used to it.</p>";

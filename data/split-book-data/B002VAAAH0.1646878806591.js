window.bookSummaryJSON = "Jane Sagan: Soldier. Killer. Lover. Dreamer. <p> In John Scalzi's best-selling <i>Old Man's War</i> series of science-fiction novels, we see this warrior woman as the other characters see her: silent and strong, from the outside. But now <i>The Sagan Diary</i> shows us Sagan from another point of view - her own. As she prepares to leave military life and join her new husband and adopted daughter on a colony world, Sagan reflects on her life, in her own words - recalling friends, battles, and experiences; illustrating all the violence and wonder of her times; trying to fit \"an entire life into this compressed space\".</p> <p>For fans of Scalzi's works, it's an intimate and surprising glimpse into one of his most popular characters. As read by Stephanie Wolfe, it's unlike any other science-fiction story you'll hear this year.</p>";

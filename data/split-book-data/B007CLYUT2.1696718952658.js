window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Night's Master</i> is the first book of the stunning arabesque high-fantasy series Tales from the Flat Earth, which, in the manner of <i>The One Thousand and One Nights,</i> portrays an ancient world in mythic grandeur via connected tales. </p><p>Long ago when the Earth was flat, beautiful, indifferent Gods lived in the airy Upperearth realm above; curious, passionate demons lived in the exotic Underearth realm below; and mortals were relegated to exist in the middle. Azhrarn, Lord of the Demons and the Darkness, was the one who ruled the night, and many mortal lives were changed because of his cruel whimsy. And yet, Azhrarn held inside his demon heart a profound mystery which would change the very fabric of the Flat Earth forever. </p><p>Come within this ancient world of brilliant darkness and beauty, of glittering palaces and wondrous elegant beings, of cruel passions and undying love. Discover the exotic wonder that is the Flat Earth.</p>";

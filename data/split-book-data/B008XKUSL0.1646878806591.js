window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The explosive finale to the Ringworld and the Fleet of Worlds series... </p> <p></p>For decades, the spacefaring species of known space have battled over the largest artifact - and grandest prize - in the galaxy: the all-but-limitless resources and technology of the Ringworld. Now, without warning, the Ringworld has vanished, leaving behind three rival war fleets. <p></p> <p>If the fallen civilization of the Ringworld can no longer be despoiled of its secrets, the puppeteers will be forced to surrender theirs - everyone knows that they are cowards. But the crises converging upon the trillion puppeteers of the <i>Fleet of Worlds</i> go far beyond even the onrushing armadas. </p> <p>Adventurer Louis Wu and the exiled puppeteer known only as Hindmost, marooned together for more than a decade, escaped from the Ringworld before it disappeared. And throughout those years, as he studied Ringworld technology, Hindmost has plotted to reclaim his power. </p> <p>One way or another, the fabled puppeteer race may have come to the end of its days. </p> <p>Larry Niven is the multiple Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of the Ringworld series, as well as many other science fiction masterpieces. His <i>Footfall,</i> coauthored with Jerry Pournelle, was a <i>New York Times</i> best seller. He lives in Chatsworth, California. </p> <p>Edward M. Lerner has degrees in physics and computer science, a background that kept him mostly out of trouble until he began writing science fiction full time. His books include <i>Probe, Moonstruck,</i> and the collection Creative Destruction. He lives in Virginia with his wife, Ruth.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One hundred years before <i>Ender's Game,</i> the aliens arrived on Earth with fire and death. <i>Earth Afire</i> by Orson Scott Card and Aaron Johnston is the story of the First Formic War. Victor Delgado beat the alien ship to Earth, but just barely. Not soon enough to convince skeptical governments that there was a threat. They didnâ€™t believe that until space stations and ships and colonies went up in sudden flame. And when that happened, only Mazer Rackham and the Mobile Operations Police could move fast enough to meet the threat.</p>";

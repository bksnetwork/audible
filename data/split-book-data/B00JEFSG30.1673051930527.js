window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Too long to be a short story, too short to be a novel - welcome to the surprisingly potent world of the novelette. The award-winning magazine <i>Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show</i> has been an online haven for this powerful form of storytelling since 2005. Now its editors have selected their all-time favorite science fiction novelettes from the magazine's eight-year history and reprinted them together in one big book of listening pleasure. Anything that is remotely possible - futures near and far, artificial intelligence and alien encounters, alternate timelines and alternate theories about creating universes, planet-eating black holes and lunar racetracks - is all here under the big tent of <i>Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show.</i></p> <p>This anthology features stories by such award-winning authors as Orson Scott Card, Wayne Wightman, Aliette de Bodard, Eric James Stone, Mary Robinette Kowal, Stephen Kotowych, Jackie Gamber, Greg Siewert, Jamie Todd Rubin, Brad R.

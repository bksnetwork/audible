window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a remote corner of early Victorian England, where traditional practices remain untouched by time, Bathsheba Everdene stands out as a beacon of female independence and self-reliance. However, when confronted with three suitors, among them the dashing Sergeant Troy, she shows a reckless capriciousness that threatens the stability of the whole community. Published in 1874, and an immediate best seller, <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> established Thomas Hardy as one of Britain's foremost novelists. </p>";

R. Martin! </b></p> <p>If the past is prologue, then George R. R. Martin’s masterwork - the most inventive and entertaining fantasy saga of our time - warrants one hell of an introduction. At long last, it has arrived with <i>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a comprehensive history of the Seven Kingdoms, providing vividly constructed accounts of the epic battles, bitter rivalries, and daring rebellions that lead to the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and HBO’s <i>Game of Thrones</i>. In a collaboration that’s been years in the making, Martin has teamed with Elio M. García, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, the founders of the renowned fan site Westeros.org - perhaps the only people who know this world almost as well as its visionary creator.&nbsp;</p> <p>Collected here is all the accumulated knowledge, scholarly speculation, and inherited folk tales of maesters and septons, maegi and singers, including:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>full family trees for Houses Stark, Lannister, and Targaryen</li> <li>in-depth explorations of the history and culture of Westeros&nbsp;</li> <li>100% all-new material, more than half of which Martin wrote specifically for this book&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>The definitive companion piece to George R. R. Martin’s dazzlingly conceived universe, <i>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</i>&nbsp;is indeed proof that the pen is mightier than a storm of swords.&nbsp;</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Devoted readers of Lady Trent's earlier memoirs, <i>A Natural History of Dragons</i> and <i>The Tropic of Serpents</i>, may believe themselves already acquainted with the particulars of her historic voyage aboard the Royal Survey ship <i>Basilisk</i>, but the true story of that illuminating, harrowing, and scandalous journey has never been revealed - until now. </p> <p>Six years after her perilous exploits in Eriga, Isabella embarks on her most ambitious expedition yet: a two-year trip around the world to study all manner of dragons in every place they might be found. From feathered serpents sunning themselves in the ruins of a fallen civilization to the mighty sea serpents of the tropics, these creatures are a source of both endless fascination and frequent peril. Accompanying her is not only her young son, Jake, but a chivalrous foreign archaeologist whose interests converge with Isabella's in ways both professional and personal. </p> <p>Science is, of course, the primary objective of the voyage, but Isabella's life is rarely so simple. She must cope with storms, shipwrecks, intrigue, and warfare, even as she makes a discovery that offers a revolutionary new insight into the ancient history of dragons. </p>";

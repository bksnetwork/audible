window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Daniel Blackland was six, he ingested his first bone fragment, a bit of kraken spine plucked out of the sand during a visit with his demanding, brilliant, and powerful magician father, Sebastian. When Daniel was 12, he watched Sebastian die at the hands of the Hierarch of Southern California, devoured for the heightened magic layered deep within his bones. </p> <p>Now, years later, Daniel is a petty thief with a forged identity. Hiding amid the crowds in Los Angeles - the capital of the Kingdom of Southern California - Daniel is trying to go straight. But his crime-boss uncle has a heist he wants Daniel to perform: break into the Hierarch's storehouse of magical artifacts and retrieve Sebastian's sword, an object of untold power. </p> <p>For this dangerous mission, Daniel will need a team he can rely on, so he brings in his closest friends from his years in the criminal world. There's Moth, who can take a bullet and heal in mere minutes. Jo Alverado, illusionist. The multitalented Cassandra, Daniel's ex. And, new to them all, the enigmatic, knowledgeable Emma, with her British accent and her own grudge against the powers that be. The stakes are high, and the stage is set for a showdown that might just break the magic that protects a long-corrupt regime. </p> <p>Extravagant yet moving, Greg van Eekhout's <i>California Bones</i> is an epic adventure set in a city of canals and secrets and casual brutality - different from the world we know yet familiar and true. </p>";

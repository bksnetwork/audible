window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There should be more to life than just surviving, even in a postapocalyptic world gone to hell. </p> <p>A lonely 18-year-old, Kris Robertson left his mountain hideaway only to discover a deserted city of isolated individuals scrambling over the debris. Young girls being abducted, wild dogs attacking people. Scared young people hiding from raiding parties and each other. Scavenging for a life among the remains of the past. There is no community, no one in charge. Kris must decide whether to assume that responsibility or walk away. </p> <p>When Kris saves two young girls from a slaver's raiding party, the decision is made for him. He discovers he is responsible for others' well-being and always will be. Realizing the only safety is in a community working together, Kris and his collected band of misfits create a sanctuary on the rooftops of the city. A place away from the wild animals and wilder men. Unfortunately anything good, anything of value, will be coveted by others. Kris and his friends must fight to save what they have built or run and never be a family again. </p>";

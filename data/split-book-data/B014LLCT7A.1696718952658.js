window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.</b></p> <p>Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds.</p> <p>When family obligations forced Waxillium Ladrian to forsake the frontier lands and return to the metropolis of his birth to take his place as head of a noble House, he little imagined that the crime-fighting skills acquired during 20 years in the dusty plains would be just as applicable in the big city. He soon learned that there, too, just being a talented Twinborn - one who can use both Allomancy and Feruchemy, the dominant magical modes on Scadrial - would not suffice.&nbsp;</p> <p>This bustling, optimistic, but still shaky society will now face its first test by terrorism and assassination, crimes intended to stir up labor strife and religious conflict. Wax, his eccentric sidekick, Wayne, and brilliant, beautiful young Marasi, now officially part of the constabulary, must unravel the conspiracy before civil strife can stop Scadrial’s progress in its tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity </i></li> </ul>";

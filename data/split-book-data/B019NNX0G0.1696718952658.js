While following the deserted I-70 toward a distant glass palace, Roland recounts a story about a seaside town called Hambry, where he fell in love with a girl named Susan Delgado, and where he and his old tet-mates Alain and Cuthbert battled the forces of John Farson, the harrier who - with a little help from a seeing sphere called Maerlyn's Grapefruit - ignited Mid-World's final war. </p>";

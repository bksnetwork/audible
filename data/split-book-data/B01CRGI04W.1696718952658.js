And he wants revenge. </p> <p>Marcus Battle has left behind his home. </p> <p>Now he's on a seemingly impossible mission to find a missing child. But can he balance that responsibility with his deep, primal desire to exact revenge on the men who destroyed his solitary existence? </p> <p>The world he discovers on his journey isn't the one he remembers before a pneumonic plague called The Scourge killed two-thirds of the world's population. It is lawless, depraved, and far deadlier than the disease which created it. </p> <p>Battle made a promise to find that child. It's a promise he regrets more acutely with every step of the journey where he is as much the hunter as he is the hunted. </p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this companion story to <i>Numbers Game</i>, Chan Norwell comes from the perfect citizen family. His mother is chief of the city monitor force, his brother an all-star, and his sister a prodigy - which leaves little wiggle room for a nobody like Chan. He is determined to have his time in the spotlight at last. But he doesn't expect things to go so horribly wrong. Alone, dishonored, and humiliated, Chan can only see one way out. </p> <p>When he meets Maizel, a brilliant redhead determined to follow in her mother's suicidal footsteps, he sees his life for what it really is. If Chan can find the courage to try one more time - if he can save Maizel - maybe there's a chance he can also save himself. </p>";

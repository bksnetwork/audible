window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joe Arden and Narrator Hall of Fame inductee Andi Arndt deliver a perfectly layered performance in <i>Cake</i>, a romance about finding love and redemption in unexpected places.</p> <p>Quiet and aloof rock star Jake McKallister and outspoken, vivacious college student Casey Caldwell are polar opposites: Casey is bubbly and talkative; Jake is reclusive. Casey enjoyed a picturesque childhood; Jake’s childhood could only be described as a well-publicized nightmare. Jake’s life revolves around music, and Casey can’t carry a tune.</p> <p>Music saved Jake, yet he lacks the outgoing personality expected of a famous performer. After surviving an unspeakable crime as a young teen, he becomes a guarded workaholic who desperately attempts to forget the past. Career success comes easily for Jake, but he struggles to make personal connections.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite their differences, Casey’s light harmonizes with Jake’s darkness, a balance embodied in the unexpectedly warm and humorous dual performance. Can the sweetness of true love overcome Jake’s tragic past?</p> <p><i>This is the first book in the Cake series, a collection of contemporary romance novels focusing on the lives of a famous family.</i>&nbsp;</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three weeks before a crucial senatorial election, a man is gunned down execution-style in a D.C. office. Police are quick to call it a case of robbery gone bad, but Frank Miles suspects something far more sinister behind the murder of his business partner. </p> <p>Washington's most feared image maker, Frank's ruthless media manipulation has earned him countless admirers...and just as many enemies. Now, for the first time in his life, Frank's met his match in a shadowy schemer as clever as himself - but far more lethal. </p> <p>As the body count rises, Frank becomes the US Attorney's chief suspect - and a cunning killer's next target. From the underground tunnels networking Capitol Hill to the dome high above, his race for the truth - and his life - will bring him face-to-face with power at its deadliest extremes - where winning isn't everything...it's the only thing. </p> <p>With his debut novel, <i>L.A. Times</i> best-selling author Robert Ellis raises the stakes in a heart pounding thriller set in Washington that feels so inside and so twisted it reeks of the darkest truth. </p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the future, mankind has abandoned Earth to ruin. But they are not alone. Advances in artificial intelligence has allowed for the creation of synthetic humanoid life. Once meant to serve on the colony worlds as slaves, most were granted their freedom to live among the humans with the same rights and privileges. Bernie Logan, stage magician, is one such synthetic. When he loses focus once his lady love disappears his manager brings in detective Noah Carver to find her. But things are not what they seem. The stakes are quickly raised when a man Carver trails is found dead and Bernie is made the prime suspect. Soon the pair find themselves in a race against time, caught up in a much larger conspiracy which threatens not only all life on their colony, but those beyond. </p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Salem, Massachusetts, was home to one of the most infamous periods in American history. False witches were burned at the stake while actual witches stood by and watched in reverie. The flames scratched the skies with horrendous height as the heart of man darkened. At least that's how the story goes. Sparrow is a teen who loves everything vintage. Jason is her best friend who relies on their friendship as a steady constant in his life. They are both eager to graduate high school and leave their old lives behind for something greater. However, neither of them could have predicted that they would find themselves in Salem, MA, during one of the world's most controversial time periods. This is a story about discovering oneself and finding out what truly matters in life. </p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Obsessed with the secret of creation, Swiss scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein cobbles together a body he's determined to bring to life. And one fateful night, he does. When the creature opens his eyes, the doctor is repulsed: his vision of perfection is, in fact, a hideous monster. Dr. Frankenstein abandons his creation, but the monster won't be ignored, setting in motion a chain of violence and terror that shadows Victor to his death.</p> <p>Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>, a gripping story about the ethics of creation and the consequences of trauma, is one of the most influential Gothic novels in British literature. It is as relevant today as it is haunting.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>Frankenstein</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>Frankenstein (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Indiana Jones meets <i>Ready Player One</i> </p> <p>Vince is a down and out millennial with an advanced degree in archaeology and an endless parade of dead end jobs. Crushed by student loan debt and bills, he is barely making ends meet, and his one source of relief is gaming. Vince gets a mysterious job offer from a gaming company to be a beta tester for their new full immersion virtual reality system. He doesn't understand why they chose him over literally anyone else on the planet, and is suspicious that he got the offer on the same day he got fired, but he's flat broke. Besides, who wouldn't want to get paid to play? </p> <p>Soon, Vince finds himself taking the role of a treasure hunter immersed in a 1920s pulp adventure filled with deadly bootleggers, spooky caves, lost airships, and a beautiful spear hurling girl who was raised by wolves. It doesn't take long for Vince to realize something fishy is going on, and there's more to this game than meets the eye. He must make his way from plot cache to plot cache as he searches for lost jewels, the truth about the game, and enough ammunition to keep the tommy gun barking. </p>";

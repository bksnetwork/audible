window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this thrilling conclusion to the Numbers Game Saga, it's been 10 weeks since Treena returned to NORA. The council has rejected her war preparations at every turn, and Dresden is backpedaling on his promises. When he tells everyone the danger has passed and denies there was ever a threat, Treena's secret followers push her to unseat Dresden and take control - something she can't bear to consider now with NORA on the brink of war. Meanwhile, infighting at Vance's settlement is turning into violent unrest and the drought has made his settlement's future bleak. Joining NORA seems inevitable, but Vance refuses to give in...not with war looming over their cities. Not when it means putting his younger sisters in danger. When Treena goes overseas to plead for help, Vance is torn between his responsibilities and his heart. Together, Treena and Vance must navigate the political undercurrents of a strange new country, convince an indifferent world of their plight, and somehow stay together despite a prince's determination to tear them apart. </p>";

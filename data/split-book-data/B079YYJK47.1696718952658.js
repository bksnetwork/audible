window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Meet the galaxy's unluckiest outlaws.</i></p> <p>Carl Ramsey is an ex-Earth Navy fighter pilot turned con man. His ship, the <i>Mobius</i>, is home to a ragtag crew of misfits and refugees looking to score a big payday but more often just scratching to pay for fuel. The crew consists of his ex-wife (and pilot), a drunkard, four-handed mechanic, a xeno-predator with the disposition of a 120kg housecat, and the galaxy's most-wanted wizard.</p> <p>Along the way, the <i>Mobius</i> crew crosses paths with the Black Ocean's vilest scum, from pirate fleets to criminal syndicates, and most law-abiding scum, including Earth Interstellar Enhanced Investigative Organization, ARGO high command, and the Convocation of Wizards.</p> <p>Time and again, riches lie just out of reach, because for all the talents Carl Ramsey and his crew possess, they've also got an outlaw's greatest weakness: a conscience.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Galaxy Outlaws</i> is a collection of all 16 Black Ocean missions chronicling the adventures of the starship <i>Mobius</i> and her crew, along with six short stories. This series is the perfect cure for the <i>Firefly</i> Season 2 blues. It's what you'd get if <i>The Orville</i> took place on <i>Serenity</i>, or if <i>Star Wars</i> had wizards instead of Jedi.</p>";

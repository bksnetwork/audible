window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the critically acclaimed author of <i>Sea of Rust</i> and <i>Queen of the Dark Things</i> comes a hair-raising collection of short fiction that illuminates the strange, humorous, fantastical, and downright diabolical that tantalize and terrorize us: demons, monsters, zombie dinosaurs, and Death itself.</p> <p>In the novella \"The Soul Thief’s Son\", C. Robert Cargill returns to the terrain of the <i>Queen of the Dark Things</i> to continue the story of Colby Stevens...</p> <p>A Triceratops and an Ankylosaurus join forces to survive a zombie apocalypse that may spell extinction for their kind in \"Hell Creek\"...</p> <p>In a grand old building atop a crack in the world, an Iraq War veteran must serve a one-year term as a punisher of the damned condemned to consume the sins of others in the hope that one day he may find peace in \"In a Clean, White Room\" (co-authored with Scott Derrickson)...</p> <p>In \"The Town That Wasn’t Anymore\", the village of Pine Hill Bluff loses its inhabitants one at a time as the angry dead return when night falls to steal the souls of the living...</p> <p>And in the title story, \"We Are Where the Nightmares Go\", a little girl crawls through a glowing door beneath her bed and finds herself trapped in a nightmarish wonderland - a crucible of the fragments of children’s bad dreams.</p> <p>These tales and four more are assembled here as testament to Cargill’s mastery of the phantasmagoric, making <i>We Are Where the Nightmares Go and Other Stories</i> a collection of unnerving horror and fantasy that will keep you up all night and haunt your waking dreams.</p>";

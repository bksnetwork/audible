window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From one of the most powerful writers in modern fiction comes a dystopian vision of a world where money reigns supreme, and nothing is so precious that it can't be bought....</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The penalty for Dani Cumali's murder: Â£84,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Theo works in the Criminal Audit Office. He assesses each crime that crosses his desk and makes sure the correct debt to society is paid in full.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>These days, there's no need to go to prison - provided that you can afford to pay the penalty for the crime you've committed. If you're rich enough, you can get away with murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But Dani's murder is different. When Theo finds her lifeless body, and a hired killer standing over her and calmly calling the police to confess, he can't let her death become just an entry on a balance sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Someone is responsible. And Theo is going to find them and make them pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Perfect for fans of speculative fiction such as </b><b><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Never Let Me Go</i></b><b>, Claire North's moving and unnerving new novel will resonate with listeners around the world.</b></p> <p>Previous books by Claire North:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><i>The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</i>&nbsp;</li> <li><i>Touch</i></li> <li><i>The Sudden Appearance of Hope</i>&nbsp;</li> <li><i>The End of the Day</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>By the same author, writing as Kate Griffin:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>A Madness of Angels</i></li> <li><i>The Midnight Mayor</i></li> <li><i>The Neon Court</i></li> <li><i>The Minority Council</i></li> <li><i>The Glass God</i></li> <li><i>Stray Souls</i></li> </ul>";

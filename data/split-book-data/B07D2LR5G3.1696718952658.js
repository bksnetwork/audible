window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A nuclear attack. A collapsing society. A world covered in ash.</p> <p><i>The Alt Apocalypse</i> is the newest ground-breaking series from Tom Abrahams.</p> <p>It explores survival under the most extreme circumstances, but with a twist (and no cliff-hangers). This series, which can be heard in any order, features the same core characters in each complete story. But every audiobook dunks them into a new, alternate apocalypse and a nuclear holocaust - an earthquake, a flood, a wildfire, a hurricane, a plague, and even zombies.</p> <p>Different heroes will emerge in each novel. Different characters will survive and perish. Your favorite character dies in one audiobook? He or she will be back in the next.&nbsp;In the end, you'll unwind the loose thread that connects every character and every stand-alone story. &nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Ash</i>, Abrahams tells the story of four college friends, an ex-con, a lonely fry cook, and a secretive group of prepared civilians as they each battle to survive in southern California after a series of nuclear attacks.&nbsp;Theirs is a gray world covered in ash and nuclear fallout.</p> <p>Do they hunker down? Do they bug out? Do they find their salvation above ground or below?<br> &nbsp;</p>";

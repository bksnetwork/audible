window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dark forces are threatening everything that Dungeon Lord Edward Wright cares about...and they don’t expect what they’re about to get.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only a few weeks have passed since the Battle of Burrova, and Edward and his friends are busier than ever improving the Haunt and protecting the surviving villagers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sadly, time is a scarce commodity in the world of Ivalis. Soon enough, Ed finds himself thrown in conflict against the man behind the mindbrood’s attack, a man who is seemingly capable of shrugging off mortal wounds and who is willing to unleash a devastating plague of undead against the Haunt and everyone inside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only the otherworldly powers of a Dungeon Lord may be capable of protecting the Haunt against the rapidly approaching danger...but can Edward remain the same man if he exposes himself to the corrupting influence of that very same power?&nbsp;</p> <p>The second installment of The Wraith's Haunt is upon us, and Soundbooth Theater had a blast producing it! In the first book, Annie Ellicott played some of SBT's creepiest monstrosities. But in this book, she's taken on the entire female cast, including Kes and Lavy who were voiced by Jeff Hays originally, and a charming new character, Katarina Locksmith, the clever thief. Annie and Jeff have been honing their vocal chemistry, and the results speak for themselves!&nbsp;</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production: <br> Jeff Hays - Narration, Characters, Production Supervision <br> Annie Ellicott - Female voices <br> Dalton Lynne - Proofing, Editing <br> Griffin Malnar - Production, Editing, Mastering</p>";

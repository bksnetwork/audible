window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When test subjects participating in secret experiments begin to mysteriously die, Cyrus Cooper, the youngest recruit of the \"Coalition\" - a secret law enforcement organization - is assigned to prevent the program’s lead researcher from being the next victim. But there’s a catch: The 74-year-old neuroscientist, Gertrude Waterford, has flatly refused any type of protective detail.</p> <p>Cyrus goes undercover, taking a position as a personal assistant in order to enter the life of the brash, elderly scientist. When multiple attempts are made on her life, however, not only must Cyrus protect the headstrong lady, but he must also uncover the perpetrator of the attacks before it’s too late.</p> <p>His job might’ve been easier if he’d been fully briefed on the nature of Waterford’s research. After working for decades to genetically trigger different paranormal gifts in her patients, she’s made some unusually powerful and extremely dangerous enemies.</p> <p>Cyrus Cooper’s efforts take him from high-rise apartments to secret underground research facilities, with stops at forgotten rendition sites and forsaken mental institutions along the way. And as the threats grow in force and number, Cyrus faces a race against time and a war where all the players on the battlefield are anything but trustworthy.</p>";

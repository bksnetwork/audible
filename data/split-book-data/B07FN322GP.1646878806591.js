window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A nuclear attack. A collapsing society. A world covered in ash.</b></p> <p><b>The Alt Apocalypse </b>is the newest groundbreaking series from Tom Abrahams.</p> <p>It explores survival under the most extreme circumstances, but with a twist (and no cliff-hangers).This series, which can be listened to in any order, features the same core characters in each complete story. But every book dunks them into a new alternate apocalypse: a nuclear holocaust, an earthquake, a flood, a wildfire, a hurricane, a plague, and even zombies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Different heroes will emerge in each novel. Different characters will survive and perish. Your favorite character dies in one book? He or she will be back in the next.&nbsp;In the end you'll unwind the loose thread that connects every character and every stand-alone story. &nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Lit</i>, Abrahams tells the story of a couple on a camping trip to the Angeles National Forest, a Los Angeles firefighter, a lonely fry cook, and a group of college students who struggle to escape and survive in Southern California after an unprecedented outbreak of wild and urban fires.</p> <p><b>Can they escape the flames? Will they become heroes or run from danger? What will it take to end a fiery hell on earth?&nbsp;</b></p>";

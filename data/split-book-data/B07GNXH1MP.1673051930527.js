window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>OCD is a mental disorder that causes people to have compulsions to do things repeatedly, such as washing their hands or checking to make sure that the door is locked. While some who have never experienced OCD may think of it as annoying or simply paranoia, it is actually harmful and, in extreme cases, can lead to suicide.</p> <p>At the core of many cases of OCD is intense anxiety. This anxiety may be connected to a past traumatic event, ongoing stress, or even a genetic predisposition. The anxiety tends to be persistent and ongoing, with the person suffering rarely getting a break.</p> <p>One of the best treatments for anxiety disorders, including OCD, is mindfulness. Mindfulness is the practice of constantly being aware of your own inner world and your environment in such a way that you are able to accept what is going on without being judgmental. Practicing mindfulness can actually alleviate some of the symptoms of OCD, helping people suffering from it get their lives back.</p> <p>This book will give you 10 different ways that you can practice mindfulness with particular information as to how each of these different ways can benefit people with OCD.</p> <p>This book is very easy to follow. It will guide you through practices such as deep breathing, meditation, journaling, being conscious of your surroundings, and slowing down a lifestyle that may actually be fueling anxiety. It includes self-reflective questions that will help you become more aware of your own anxiety, how it contributes to your OCD, and what practical steps you can take.</p> <p>Best of luck to you as you seek to become more mindful and start to overcome your OCD.</p>";

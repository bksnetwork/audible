window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Their journey begins....</i></b></p> <p>The human race has turned to dust. August Morrison faces it after rising from the depths of a dark matter research facility in Arizona. His co-workers. His daughter. All of them: dust. Friends and colleagues around the world don’t answer their phones. The city of Phoenix burns. He is alone. As a world without mankind starts to crumble, August fights not just for survival, but for his very sanity.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the other side of the country, Poe McDowell watches her parents crumble into dust just moments after being shoved inside a coffin-like device that spares her from the same fate. She emerges to find not just her mother and father, but also her neighbors - her entire town’s human population - reduced to grit. Unlike August, she’s not entirely alone, but the life growing in her belly isn’t much company.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then, hope. A drunken and desperate August broadcasts over the ham radio network and connects with his fellow survivor, Poe, alone and pregnant in a snow blanketed New Hampshire. Determined to reach her, August sets out on a cross-country trek. But the world is not as empty as it seems. Lights in the sky reveal that they are not alone. The human race’s demise was not natural - and the architects are searching for survivors.</p> <p><b><i>...at the end.</i></b></p> <p>Jeremy Robinson, whose stories have been compared to Michael Crichton, James Rollins, and Stephen King, is the international best-selling master of stories featuring mind-bending imagination, terrifying monsters and high-octane action. With <i>The Distance</i>, he is joined by his wife, Hilaree Robinson, whose passionate writing and characters make this novel a truly unique and exciting experience that will leave readers both enthralled and moved.</p>";

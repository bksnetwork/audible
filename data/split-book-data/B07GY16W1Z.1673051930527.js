window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A wildly exciting journey through a world remade, <i>The Divide</i> combines real characters with horrifically realized creations, pitting the worst of human nature against the strength of family. Equal parts action, horror, and moving drama that only Jeremy Robinson can pull off.</p> <p>When the divide is crossed...&nbsp;</p> <p>No one remembers how the Divide was created. The miles-deep and miles-wide chasm has existed for hundreds of years, protecting what remains of humanity from the Golyat: a creature whose shadow moves across the horizon at sunset.&nbsp;</p> <p>Davina, daughter of Jesse, is a shepherd. She spends her days guiding herds of deer through the forests of New Inglan, protecting them from predators, herding them away from the Divide, and ensuring the tribe of Essex has meat when needed. While many shepherds die in their first year - from the elements, from injury, or in the jaws of a wolf - Davina is resilient.</p> <p>Having just slain a mountain lion, Davina returns to her village to discover a hunting party has been sent out in search of the Modernists, a group fascinated with the past, the technology that once filled the world, and what lies beyond the Divide. To keep the Modernists from reaching the Divide's far side and revealing humanity's presence to the Golyat, the hunters will torture and kill them all. Including Davina's teenage son.&nbsp;</p> <p>Davina strikes out, intending to ensure her son's death will be quick and without torture. Reaching the island of Boston first, Davina confronts the Modernists and finds herself incapable of taking her son's life. Captured by the enemies of Essex, she is transported across the Divide along with her son and the Modernists.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the first time in 500 years, humanity steps foot on the Divide's far side. Stranded with the enemy, Davina must fight to keep them all alive, herding people instead of deer, while uncovering the truth about humanity's past and her connection to events that reshaped the world.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The pumps fail. The walls break. The city drowns.</p> <p>The Alt Apocalypse is the newest groundbreaking series from Tom Abrahams. It explores survival under the most extreme circumstances, but with a twist (and no cliff-hangers). This series, which can be listened to in any order, features the same core characters in each complete story. But every audiobook dunks them into a new, alternate apocalypse: a nuclear holocaust, an earthquake, a flood, a wildfire, a hurricane, a plague, and even zombies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Different heroes will emerge in each novel. Different characters will survive and perish. Your favorite character dies in one audiobook? He or she will be back in the next. In the end, you'll unwind the loose thread that connects every character and every stand-alone story.&nbsp;</p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>Torrent</i>, Abrahams plunges his characters into an unforgiving flood.&nbsp;College students on vacation, a family trapped and unable to swim, a journalist out of his depth, and a doctor prepared but overwhelmed all face the rising water. The beginnings of a conspiracy begin to surface, possibly connecting strangers and their roles in catastrophes they only vaguely recall.</p> <p>Some live.&nbsp;Some die. All struggle.</p>";

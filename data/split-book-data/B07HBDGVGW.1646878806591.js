window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In today’s world, we have fast-food restaurants and a lot of prepared meals to simply pop into a microwave for convenience.&nbsp;But have you ever really thought about the weight you gain from them?</p> <p>Most people don’t. Then one day, they say, “I need to go on a diet.” There is another dilemma: Which one? There are a lot of diet plans that sound easy enough to cook. But will you actually stick to it? Is it simple and delicious? If it isn’t, you’re probably doomed to failure.</p> <p>There is a lot of science out there that proves that a low-carb diet is the best one for the body, eliminating processed sugars and wheat flour.&nbsp;Not only are the recipes simple, but they are also ketogenic. Ketogenic diets adjust the use of glucose in the body, still fueling your brain and your body without the side effect of weight gain. Instead of processed sugar, the added ketones in your body are converted to protein, which are healthier for you.</p> <p>Instead of doing a sugar load for energy, you can follow some simple and delicious recipes to bring your weight gain under control and then begin to lose weight.</p> <p>Not only does this audiobook give some delicious recipes to try, but you will learn how to follow a low-carb diet on your own, revising your own recipes for a low-carb lifestyle.&nbsp;</p> <p>You will make some changes from a traditional diet based on fast foods and microwave instant dinners, but you will also find bigger benefits in this type of diet.</p> <p>For example, it reduces heart disease and helps to control diabetes. Processed foods usually contain a lot of fat, sugar, and sodium. But combined with carbs, you have the “double-whammy” of converted sugars in your bloodstream that tend to become fat in your body.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you use a ketogenic, low-carb diet, not only do you have a simple and delicious way to eat, but you find the best way to maintain your weight as well as your energy. You can also maintain diabetes with this diet under the guidance of your physician.</p>";

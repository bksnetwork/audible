window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Smith reads excerpts from her memoirs, <i>Just Kids</i> and <i>M Train</i>, in her signature deadpan tone, interspersed with folksy comic banter and personal stories from her life as a cutting-edge urban punk artist. The emotionality deepens when narrative segues into song and the poetry of lyrics. The combination of intimate setting and musings by a first-rate performance artist makes for a compelling listen.\" (<i>AudioFile </i>magazine)</p> <p><i>Patti Smith at the Minetta Lane</i> features live audio of performances captured over three evenings in September of 2018 at the Minetta Lane Theatre in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, woven into a single, one-of-a-kind audio event. Pioneering artist and writer Patti Smith commands the stage to perform original spoken-word stories from her life, interwoven with the music of her beloved catalogue, played live by Smith, her son and daughter–Jackson and Jesse Paris Smith–and longtime collaborator Tony Shanahan. What transpires is a personally revelatory showcase, an intimate portrait of an icon, focusing on family and taking stock of a near to 50-year career devoted to artistic integrity.&nbsp;</p>";

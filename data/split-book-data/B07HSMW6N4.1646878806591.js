window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Superfoods are culinary superheroes. Their powers make you healthier and more energetic! Superfoods are not super expensive; anyone can afford them. What no one can afford is to be unhealthy. What is the first step toward getting healthy? It's by eating healthy! This book will teach you how to do just that!</p> <p>All these recipes take less than an hour to create and begin to enjoy. One of the common benefits of many superfoods is better regulation of blood sugar. Your cholesterol will lower, and you could lose weight by eating properly and exercising an adequate amount every day, or at least several times a week. Many superfoods are jam-packed with antioxidants which help ward off cancer and are great for your skin, eyes, and hair.</p> <p>Another great benefit of many healthy superfoods is omega-3. These omegas help keep your brain and your heart healthy and strong. To get the full spectrum of benefits, you need to regularly consume the rainbow. What is meant by that is to eat as many colorful fruits, vegetables, legumes, and beans as possible. Try to stay away from meats, like red meat and pork, with an excessive amount of saturated fats in them.</p> <p>This book is great for people who do not think they have a lot of time to eat healthily and get the benefits from a super healthy and nutritious diet!&nbsp;</p> <p>The majority of all the ingredients are all low fat, delicious, and guilt-free. This book has 18 recipes for each meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All have multiple healthy foods to add in to your diet. Even if you just want a quick snack, this book has you covered.</p> <p>You have choices ranging from oatmeal (overnight and even oatmeal mixes) to smoothies; from seafood to salads. For all of your vegetarian or vegan superfoodies out there, there are plenty of options for any type of diet.</p> <p>Also, in the very beginning of this book, there is a list of superfoods for any person in every form that heath may take. There is something for everyone in this book, including pregnant women who need a little bit of energy, people over the age of 50, or you are a parent looking to better your child's diet.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p>";

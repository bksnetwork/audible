But for someone who should have been hailed as a pioneer in the genre, there was little information available. For, as O’Meara soon discovered, Patrick’s contribution had been claimed by a jealous male colleague, her career had been cut short, and she soon after had disappeared from film history. No one even knew if she was still alive.</p> <p>As a young woman working in the horror film industry, O’Meara set out to right the wrong and in the process discovered the full, fascinating story of an ambitious, artistic woman ahead of her time. Patrick’s contribution to special effects proved to be just the latest chapter in a remarkable, unconventional life, from her youth growing up in the shadow of Hearst Castle, to her career as one of Disney’s first female animators. And at last, O’Meara discovered what really had happened to Patrick after <i>The Creature</i>’s success and where she went.</p> <p>A true-life detective story and a celebration of a forgotten feminist trailblazer, Mallory O’Meara’s <i>The Lady from the Black Lagoon</i> establishes Patrick in her rightful place in film history while calling out a Hollywood culture where little has changed since.&nbsp;</p> <p>Don't miss Mallory O'Meara's upcoming novel, <i>Girly Drinks!</i>&nbsp;</p>";

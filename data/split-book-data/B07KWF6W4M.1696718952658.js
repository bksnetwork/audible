window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a deeply moving and warm performance, Ambreen Razia delivers her bold and provocative one-woman play that confronts—and dismantles—stereotypes surrounding Muslim women.</p> <p>Growing up in downscale urban London wearing hoop earrings and a hijab, Shaheeda, the British Muslim teen at the center of <i>The Diary of a Hounslow Girl</i>, balances the expectations of her family and the temptations of city life.

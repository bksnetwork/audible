window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ty Wilcox didn’t really believe in superheroes before he became one himself. Now, he has an incredible power he’s just beginning to understand, lives in a mansion, and is in a relationship with two of the most amazing women alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But when a flying, teleporting demon-woman appears outside his work, the price of his new life becomes apparent.&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s a supervillain after the device that gives Ty his power. This villain will do anything to get it, and has an entire army at his command. The price of Ty’s new life is never-ending danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning and minor spoilers: Just like book 1, <i>Enhancer 2</i> is an 18+ book intended for mature listeners. It contains sex, violence, and nudity. It includes very light gamelit elements, occasional bad language, and is set in a cyberpunk alternate future. Within it you will find threats, battles, destruction of property, evil plans, betrayals, wrongful imprisonment, major violence, death, and the unfortunate realities of living in a world dominated by mega-corporate greed. The malevolent boss from book 1 is still there, as is the monstrous bad guy. But so are the gorgeous superheroes who are comfortable with unconventional, harem relationships, and there might be someone new in that mix as well.</p>";

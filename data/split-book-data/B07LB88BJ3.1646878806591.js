window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>A relentless&nbsp;disease.&nbsp;No cure. And no way to stop it.</i></b></p> <p>The Alt Apocalypse&nbsp;is the newest ground-breaking series from Tom Abrahams.</p> <p>It explores survival under the most extreme circumstances, but with a twist (<i>and no cliffhangers</i>). This series, which can be heard in any order, features the same core characters in each complete story. But every book dunks them into a new, alternate apocalypse: a nuclear holocaust, an earthquake, a flood, a wildfire, a hurricane, a plague, and even zombies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Different heroes will emerge in each novel. Different characters will survive and perish. Your favorite character dies in one book? He or she will be back in the next.&nbsp;In the end you'll unwind the loose thread that connects every character and every stand-alone story.&nbsp;</p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>Affliction</i>, Abrahams tells the story of a mysterious team of researchers, four college friends, an ex-con, a lonely fry cook,&nbsp;and a secretive group of prepared civilians as they each battle to survive in southern California after an outbreak of a new, deadly disease with no known cure.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Can they find a way to stop it?&nbsp;Can they survive in an afflicted world?</b></p>";

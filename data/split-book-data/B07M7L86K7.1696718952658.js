window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An utterly unsentimental journey toward the end of life, <i>Mala</i> is an irreverent exploration of how we live, cope, and survive in the moment. Grounded in distinctive emotional language and sharp humor, this powerful one-woman show written and performed by Melinda Lopez (<i>Sonia Flew</i>) dances between a mother’s growing frailty and a daughter’s quest for grace—all set during an epic Boston winter. Rather than depict a right way, the play opens the door for conversation regarding our universal struggle to support those we love in dying, especially when all we’ve ever focused on is surviving.</p> <p>Funny, brutally honest, and ultimately cathartic, <i>Mala</i>—which won the Elliot Norton Award for Best New Play in 2017—puts a sharp focus on what it means to put our loved ones first, right to the very end, and what happens when we strive to be good but don’t always succeed.</p> <p>Mala <i>was written with the support of the Mellon Foundation’s National Playwright Residency Program, administered in partnership with Howlround. </i>Mala <i>was originally produced by Arts Emerson. Special thanks to P Carl, David Dower, Peter DuBois and the Huntington Theatre Company.</i></p> <p>Experience this title in immersive 3D audio by <a href=\"https://help.audible.com/s/article/how-can-i-change-the-download-format-settings-in-the-audible-for-android-and-audible-for-ios-apps/\">setting your download quality to High</a> within the app. Headphones recommended.

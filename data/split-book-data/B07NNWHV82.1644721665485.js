window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kit Harington (<i>Games of Thrones</i>) and Johnny Flynn (<i>Beast</i>) smolder and burn as sparring brothers in Sam Shepard’s darkly comic 1980 drama. The Cain and Abel conflict is a showdown of sibling rivalry, to be sure, but also bears witness to a legacy of booze-fueled family brawls. As Harington and Flynn duel it out, they bring a cagey, wiry energy to director Matthew Dunster’s West End revival of this Pulitzer Prize finalist. The portrait of the estranged pair is a riveting study in contrasts as Harington’s successful screenwriter and Flynn’s scheming grifter explosively collide in the California desert. The scorched, arid setting is more than just a backdrop; its expanse and emptiness make it a palpable presence in a play about wounded masculinity and broken dreams.&nbsp;</p> <p>The live theatre production of <i>True West</i> was performed at the Vaudeville Theatre in London, United Kingdom, in 2019. It was produced by Joseph Smith and John Brant for Smith &amp; Brant Theatricals and James Bierman for Empire Street Productions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Portions of this audio drama contain mature language and themes. Listener discretion is advised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Chase Yarden never thought he'd see her again, but there she was sipping coffee in a tiny café in Venice. She looked different, but he would know her anywhere - the woman who ruined his life.</p> <p>The four Yarden boys loved the four Ward girls nearly all their lives, a fact the small town of Douglas, Texas wouldn't soon forget. On a night of celebration, one of the Ward girls is shot dead in the street. Only days later, the entire Ward family vanishes, leaving nothing behind but four broken men.</p> <p>Long after the girls are gone, the boys are left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives - a difficult task when left with more questions than answers. Determined to find those answers, Chase sets out to track down his ex-fiancé with the help of her sister's journal. The secrets he reads between the faded leather cover torment him until finding her becomes his sole purpose in life.</p> <p>Five long years pass with nothing more than a few measly leads until one day the woman appears out of nowhere with a warning Chase isn't keen on hearing. Chase is thrust into a world he'd only seen in movies. Assassins, spies, murder, and mayhem - the stuff of his worst nightmares become a reality he cannot escape.</p> <p>Once desperate to find answers no matter the cost, Chase soon realizes the price may be higher than he was willing to pay. With enemies around every corner, Chase and his brothers find themselves in the middle of an international war that began long before they were born.</p> <p>Can the Yarden boys trust the Ward girls with their lives, or will they pay the ultimate sacrifice?</p> <p><i>Psych Ward</i> is a wildly sarcastic depiction of how the average Joe might survive a personal Armageddon.</p>";

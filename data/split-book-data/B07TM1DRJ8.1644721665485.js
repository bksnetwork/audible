Feeling complicit in this destruction, the Defenders offer seven immortal survivors of Earth a one-time chance to change history for hundreds of planets.</p> <p>A successful mission would cost these humans their immortality and erase the last 50 years of their lives on New Earth, as an alternate reality would be created.</p> <p>Will these people be willing to make the sacrifice?

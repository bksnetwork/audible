window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Time travel. Alien bug-monsters. Beautiful women.</b></p> <p><b>Not bad for a strip-club bouncer with a talent for slowing down time.</b><br> &nbsp;</p> <p>I never thought my power was good for anything really important. It was useful for helping me win fistfights against drunken customers, and for ogling the girls onstage. But saving the multiverse against a plague of inter-dimensional monsters?<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>That was a bit out of my league. <br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Or so I believed. But then a massive time-rift opened up behind the club, and a mad old time wizard saved my life. Now, here I am, careening through time in an old hippie van, with two crazy-hot strippers and an AI at my side, trying to level up enough to defeat the monsters.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Sure, there’s a damn good chance I’ll die trying, but it ought to be one hell of a ride.<br> &nbsp;</p> <p><b>Note:</b> This book contains harem elements.</p>";

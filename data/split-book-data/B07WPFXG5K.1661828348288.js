The technology the Mozari left behind has advanced scientific understanding at breakneck speeds, giving humanity the chance to fight back against their Gresian foes. Spaceworthy vessels and all-new weaponry are pumped out of orbiting factories, boarded by the brightest minds to begin colonizing new planets.&nbsp;</p> <p>But humanity is still vulnerable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lieutenant Daniel West understands this, which is why his recruits are the most highly trained the military puts out - regardless of the physical and mental demand it takes to make them that way. Any soldier in the newly created Special Warfare Task Force must plan and prepare for every possible scenario.&nbsp;</p> <p>After all, the return of the Gresians isn’t just inevitable. It’s imminent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now assigned to the United Earth Ship <i>Shenzhen</i>, Daniel is chosen to command a platoon to protect a team of elite colonists traveling to LTT-8270. But it isn’t until their arrival that the true mission becomes evident, and Daniel discovers an even more horrifying truth.&nbsp;</p> <p>A truth that demands too high a cost for humanity’s future.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>This novel contains violence and profanity.</i></p>";

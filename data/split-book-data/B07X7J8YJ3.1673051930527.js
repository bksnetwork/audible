window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The much-anticipated sequel to <i>Zero G</i> and the middle grade debut by Dan Wells.</p> <p>The colonists from the<i> Pathfinder</i> have arrived on Kaguya, a planet with low gravity but a very dense atmosphere. It’s fun to jump around, but the air makes you loopy. Even worse than that, the heavy atmosphere means that wind storms, although rare, are absolutely devastating.</p> <p>Zero and Nyx help to get everything locked down before the first big storm, but they stumble onto a group of thieves who have stolen some mining equipment. Before the kids have a chance to get away and tell anyone, the storm hits and the massive winds carry them far away. Zero and Nyx are stranded on an unknown planet with no way to communicate, being chased by thieves, and with another storm bearing down on them.</p> <p>And, oh yeah, this planet has <i>dragons.</i></p> <p>It will take more than just good luck to get back to the colony. It’s going to take <i>science.</i></p>";

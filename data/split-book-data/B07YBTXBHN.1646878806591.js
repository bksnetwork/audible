window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An alien stranded on Earth. A tall warrior woman. Two fates forever connected.</b></p> <p>Marooned in 19th century West, Llewellyn is someone who should not exist. During a raid on a Comanche camp, he rescues Anna - a young, strong frontier woman. The two become friends and comrades, their fates forever intertwined. They find themselves together in the prairies of 19th-century Texas, the bordellos of Civil War-era New Orleans, the Prohibition in the 1920s, the Great Depression, and the vastness of space.</p> <p>But can they survive hardships through history, the enmity of their southern neighbors, and the Civil War to return to his home planet and exact his revenge?</p> <p>\"A page-turning, extraordinary excursion that crosses genres.\" (Daniel Scott White, editor of <i>Unfit Magazine</i>)</p>";

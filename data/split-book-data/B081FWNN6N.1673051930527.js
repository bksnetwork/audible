window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For 100 years, the Amphibite Empire ruled Earth. To disagree with them is to die. Detective David Ferguson knows better than to argue: limping from place to place on his cane, he’s just itching to get a good case thrown his way.</p> <p>Police Chief Teagarden gave him a missing persons case. A comfort girl who went off the grid. It should have been simple. But his best bet for tracking her down is a lowlife drug pusher who’s pushing something a lot more dangerous: truth.</p> <p>Maybe the Empire is not all it seems. Maybe it’s all smoke and mirrors. Maybe its hiding something much simpler - and more sinister as a result. As Ferguson falls deeper into the web of suspicion and lies, he learns that the truth hiding in lies is always the most volatile...</p>";

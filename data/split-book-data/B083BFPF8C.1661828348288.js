The only hope Edward and his friends have at surviving the wrath of the Light is an ancient Factory whose defenses are as deadly as those seeking to conquer it.</p> <p>However, Ed is not the only Dungeon Lord who seeks the power of the factory. To save the Haunt, Ed must face war-forged Dungeon Lords older and crueler than he is, and everything he has learned shall be tested to its utter limit.</p> <p>Even before the Endeavor starts, dark forces converge around the Haunt, threatening to drown Ed and his friends under a mass of corpses.

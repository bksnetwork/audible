window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jump back in time with this retro sci-fi short story from the seven-time Hugo Award-winning author Poul Anderson. You'll also enjoy the introductory biography of the prolific sci-fi author, as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The way we feel about another person, or about objects, is often bound up in associations that have no direct connection with the person or object at all. Often, what we call a \"change of heart\" comes about simply from a change in the many associations which make up our present viewpoint. Now, suppose these associations could be altered artificially, at the choice of the person who was in charge of the process.</p> <p><b>Enjoy this classic work!</b></p>";

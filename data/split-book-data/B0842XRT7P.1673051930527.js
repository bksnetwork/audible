window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Professor Louis Mooreâ€™s audiobook about the history of African Americans in sports in the United States educates listeners about the fascinating social and cultural history of the nation. For example, integration of major league and professional sports broke a major color barrier for one of the first times in the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. African American athletes competed in America long before the 20th century - in fact, they even competed during the years of slavery.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Boxer Tom Molineaux, who fought for the entertainment of slave masters, went on to earn his freedom, and then became a professional fighter and trainer</li> <li>Champion boxer Jack Johnson</li> <li>High jumper Rose Robinson</li> <li>Track star and four-time Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens</li> <li>Baseball legend Jackie Robinson</li> <li>Decathlon gold-medalist Rafer Johnson</li> <li>The first female African American Olympians, Tidye Picket and Louise Stokes</li> </ul> <p>Hear how the struggles and triumphs of these and other African American sports stars opened doors for professional players who came to dominate their fields, including Serena Williams and Michael Jordan. Learn about the founding of Black sports leagues during the years of segregation, how the Great Migration reshaped athletics in America, and how African American athletes balanced their athletic success with the everyday reality of racism and became engines of social change. While sports helped level the playing field in many ways, Black athletes still grapple with the legacy of inequality in America today.&nbsp;</p>";

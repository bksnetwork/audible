window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A magical skeleton, an office lady, and a corporate mercenary team walk onto a Histaff-infected planet. If only there was a joke in there somewhere.</b><br> </p> <p>Douglas crash lands on the planet Evengi Prime and proceeds to do what he does best: Repetitive chaos. He tries to set a plastic table on fire and makes a few pretty pink mushroom clouds, but luckily the planet is long dead and its current inhabitants are incapable of lodging complaints. He then finds a new friend in a familiar body, who helps him make sense of the strange world while getting used as a test dummy for new spells.</p> <p>Fienak, a kidnapped street rat, gets caught up in this particular mess when her mercenary team is sent to investigate a rumored death, namely that of super-corporation owner \"Solan\". Yet before the scouting expedition can truly get started, they stumble across ghosts from the past...and a planet-spanning bioweapon that is much more awake than expected.</p> <p>Join Douglas on his quest for monotonous tasks, junk food, and maybe becoming a space cop!</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Who reminds you of Donald Trump more? John F. Kennedy or Richard Nixon? Keep that thought to yourself for a second as I remind you that JFK and Nixon ran against each other in 1960. A member of a popular two-term administration ran against a phenom running without permission. The race saw a revolutionary use of new media. The side that lost tells anyone who will listen that nefarious outside help tipped the election. This is the story of 1960 and if we'd known more about it we'd have been less surprised when the events replayed themselves in 2016. John F. Kennedy only won one race for the White House and his slogan for that race was \"Get American Moving Again\" News dies and becomes history, but tonight? We raise the dead.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Celebrate Pride with Shangela (<i>RuPaul’s Drag Race</i>), Nikki Levy (Don’t Tell My Mother!), and six fabulous storytellers as they share heartfelt, hilarious, true tales about coming out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Coming Out Party</i>, produced especially for Pride Month in collaboration with the acclaimed live show Don’t Tell My Mother!, brings Audible members a collection of uplifting, raw, and hilarious stories from queer actors, comedians, and personalities. Cohosted by beloved drag queen Shangela and storytelling maven Nikki Levy, <i>Coming Out Party</i> is a joyous celebration of LGBTQIA+ people and personalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ll hear live stories from <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> star Jake Borelli, whose on-screen journey inspired him to come out IRL, comic Nicky Paris (<i>Wendy Williams</i>), whose high school production of <i>Peter Pan</i> taught him \"how to grow up\", and comic Daniel Webb, who was so fabulous he never really needed to come out...that is, until he met Barack Obama in a BBQ joint. You’ll also hear stories told from inside the closet (literally, from our makeshift home studios - a certain virus cancelled our live shows, but it can’t hurt our pride). Hear how <i>The L Word</i>’s Rosanny Zayas had her first kiss with the coolest girl in school, how <i>Pose</i>’s Angelica Ross navigated “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” during her time in the navy, and how author Lisa Dickey came out...to the secretary of state himself.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pride might look different this year, but it can never be canceled! Listen in!</p>";

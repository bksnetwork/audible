What more could Zeke and his team want?</p> <p>Taking the time to train and rearm themselves seems like a great idea now that they are all back together, but nothing is ever that easy. An unexpected ‘guest’ puts the growing village of Sunrise in danger, but the uneasy alliance that grows allows the group to start tracking the location of another General. Royal negotiations, his growing relationship with a certain Fae Queen, and the threat of the Drow - seems like Zeke and the crew have their work cut out for them.</p> <p>Not all is as it seems, and the boys will have to be more than they ever have been if they want to survive the journey Into the Darkness.</p>";

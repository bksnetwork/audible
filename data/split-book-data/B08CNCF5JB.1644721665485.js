window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Rick Philips isn't a fighter, but he is a survivor.</b></p> <p>Haunted by memories of a high school shooting, not even the bottle can wash away the gnawing guilt and creeping feelings of inadequacy that batter Rick's conscience daily.</p> <p>His life has been a mess of broken marriages, writer's block, terrible choices, and the morbid pity of others. When he meets Harriet at a writer's conference, the record doesn't scratch as he falls back. Only, this time, he may not get up.</p> <p><b>Harriet Bristol Wheeler is a dark temptress and a self-confessed serial killer.</b></p> <p>Harriet has no problem killing and even fewer issues blending back into the background after the act with the cool, calculating eye of a practiced social chameleon.</p> <p>Manipulative, unpredictable, and exceptionally intelligent, she's Rick's worst nightmare and the ideal subject for his next book. A book that they are both desperate to write.</p> <p><b>Time is running out, but the sadness will last forever.</b></p> <p>In the vein of Stieg Larsson and Thomas Harris, <i>Combustible Punch </i>is a memorable novel that captivates listeners and lingers long after you finish listening.</p>";

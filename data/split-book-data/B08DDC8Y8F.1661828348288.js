window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From playwright, author, and Oscar-nominated actor Jesse Eisenberg, <i>When You Finish Saving the World</i> tells the moving and evocative story of three individuals working to understand each other and themselves: Nathan, a father learning to connect with his newborn son; Rachel, a young college student seeking to find her place in a relationship and in life, before marriage to Nathan; and Ziggy, their son, a teenager hoping to figure out where he came from, and where he’s headed. The shifts between time frames in these characters’ lives span more than a decade and eloquently capture the complexities of growing up, having children, and fitting in.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eisenberg - the star of <i>The Social Network</i>, <i>The Squid and the Whale</i>, and <i>Zombieland </i>- stars as Nathan; Kaitlin Dever, star of <i>Booksmart </i>and <i>Unbelieveable</i>, is the voice of Rachel; and Finn Wolfhard, star of <i>Stranger Things</i>, plays Ziggy, their son.&nbsp;</p>";

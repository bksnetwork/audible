Time for patient zero to step up.</b></p> <p>The human race has become an endangered species in the two weeks since the bomb fell in Seattle. Luckily for Digby, that’s not his problem. Skyline believes that he and his coven were burnt to cinders, so all he needs to do is lay low. Well, that was what he hoped would happen.</p> <p>Instead, Henwick’s plan to hijack the curse was successful, spreading a new kind of monster across the land. They’re faster, stronger, and more lethal than the dead that came before. With these creatures on the prowl, it doesn’t take long before the apocalypse once again comes knocking at Digby’s door.</p> <p>His plan to laze around is foiled, so Digby grudgingly sets out in search of a new home. With new allies and adversaries to keep an eye on, his coven will have to uncover the secrets behind Henwick’s plans.</p> <p>Is creating a safe haven enough, or will Digby be forced to go to war?</p>";

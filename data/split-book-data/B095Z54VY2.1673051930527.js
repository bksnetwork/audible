window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A \"harmless\" VR game test proves to be anything but....</b></p> <p>Almost as exciting as the chance to have archeologist Brian Harris' dig sites modeled in an interactive virtual reality is the chance to alpha-test the newest Terramyr Online game for the company providing the tech.&nbsp;</p> <p>The arrangement is simple, test the game, play the main storyline, and report any glitches. In return, the game's main designer will render fully virtual models of the dig sites that will not only ensure Brian's successful graduation but set him up for life as he uncovers the secrets hidden within a trio of ancient Chilean volcanoes. Stavtech's main developer is ridiculously demanding, but a sneak peek at the game is too good to pass up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trouble is, some of the glitches are interfering with the dig. Throw in the fact that the volcanoes are more active than they have been in the last several decades, and Brian is in for the challenge of his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Somehow, he needs to finish the dig in three weeks, otherwise, the Chilean government is going to shut the site down for fear of a volcanic eruption. Grabbing his shovel and pick by day, and fighting monsters, bosses, and hunting down glitches by night, Brian soon becomes embroiled in an adventure that will change the course of his life forever...as long as he doesn't die first.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Don't miss an LitRPG adventure unlike any you've ever experienced before. Equal parts </b><b><i>Epic Fantasy World</i></b><b> and Indiana Jones, it has everything for lovers of the genre. </b></p> <p><b>This book includes: Skill trees that compliment each class, experienced-based leveling, guild questlines, unique races, companions, plenty of stats, and much more.</b></p>";

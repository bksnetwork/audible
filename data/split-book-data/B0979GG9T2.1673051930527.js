They were right.</p> <p>Calamity created the Epics: humans with incredible powers they didn't deserve.</p> <p>They could have saved mankind. They could have lifted us into harmony and prosperity. Instead they burned. They slaughtered. They conquered. And then they ruled.</p> <p>Jax has learned all of this the hard way. Orphaned at an early age, he's spent most of his childhood training to be a Reckoner - determined to find the Epics' weaknesses, unlock their secrets, and protect those of us who are still left.</p> <p>But now, the mysterious High Epic Lifeforce has arrived with his flying city, Lux, to plunder what's left of Texas. So Jax and his ragtag team - the few who remain of the once-mighty Texas Reckoners - must take their battle to this floating fortress of riches - and defeat the invincible.</p> <p>To avenge what has been lost. And rise anew.</p>";

Unbeknownst to Nimon, Jax and the vast majority of his people are far out to sea, aboard ships that are only partially operational, and the enemy's forces are drawing closer to his home by the hour.</p> <p>Jax must choose: Protect the refugees and risk the Dark Legion reaching his home first, or take a far smaller force and intercept the threat head on.

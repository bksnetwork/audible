Gods clash over the fate of the realm itself....</p> <p>Arek cooks lasagna, and tops it with a dash of finely chopped basil.</p> <p>An orc who has seen more than his fair amount of fighting, Arek wants nothing more than to spend the rest of his days cooking and away from the chaos of combat.</p> <p>However, when Ming and her group of adventurers hire him as their full-time chef, his plans of avoiding violence crumble. He longs to leave his blood-soaked mistakes in his past, but old friends and foes have different ideas.</p> <p><b><i>Cleaver's Edge</i></b><b> is the first book in a Fantasy / LitRPG lite series with a cooking element that's perfect for the holiday season.

Only a brave few still stand against the darkness.</p> <p>Jason dreams of joining the glorious Shadowfront and battling the enemy known only as the Void. But, as a lowly Pastfinder, he is denied that path and forced to serve as little more than a glorified scavenger.</p> <p>It is only when he chances upon the ruins of a long dead civilization that his fortunes change. Jason discovers a forgotten form of cultivation, one fueled by the ghosts of centuries-lost history and powerful, forbidden knowledge.</p> <p>For the first time in his life, Jason has the strength to join the fight against the shadows.</p> <p>But, if his fellow tribesmen learn of his new power's cursed origins, the Void will be the least of his concerns....</p> <p><b>Inspired by the worlds of Xianxia and Wuxia, Julian Gyll brings a fresh, western fantasy take on the burgeoning cultivation genre. </b></p>";

He would stride past Silverâ€™s grace and ascend all the way to the gold peaks of royalty, earning for himself privileges that only the true elites of the school could enjoy. After all the trials and tribulations he had suffered, a prize worthy of the most privileged cultivators was finally within his grasp.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>So, he would climb those golden steps just as far as they would take him, even if they led to the very heavens above.</b></p>";

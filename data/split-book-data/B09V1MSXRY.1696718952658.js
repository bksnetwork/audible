Necessity drives this recluse from the Statuary to find a new servant. The villagers thereabouts fear him - with good reason - but when people are poor, and homes are crowded, all it takes is a handful of coins to loosen family ties.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tupper Meadowsweet isn’t the cleverest child, but he’s brave enough to follow Freydolf onto the gray mountain, where the Statuary’s living masterpieces hint at faraway lands, diverse races, unique customs, long histories, and danger.....</p>";

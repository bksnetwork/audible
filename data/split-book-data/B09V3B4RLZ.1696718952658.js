Great blimps took to the sky, belching steam and smoke, as metal city-states sprouted like weeds below.</p> <p>Angel, a daring adventurer in the pursuit of powerful magic, scours the desert endlessly, in search of ancient magic. When he’s given an offer he can’t refuse, he finds out that he’s not the only one seeking lost knowledge. Others also seek the same power, but their methods leave cities razed in acrid smoke and the innocent in their wake.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a race against a group who has lived in the shadows since the Great War, Angel will have to determine just how far he’s willing to go to accomplish his goals.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Experience the start of a Magitech LitRPG series by Actus, the author of </b><b><i>Cleaver's Edge</i></b><b>. Set in a steampunk fantasy world, it's perfect for fans of </b><b><i>Arcane </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> Final Fantasy</i></b><b>.</b></p>";

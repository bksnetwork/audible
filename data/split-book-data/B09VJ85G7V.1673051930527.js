window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A #1 Amazon Charts and </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestseller.</b></p> <p><b>A bittersweet short story about mothers, daughters, and the witches’ brew of love—and control—that binds them, by the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Testaments</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Life is hard enough for a teenage girl in 1950s suburbia without having a mother who may—or may not—be a witch. A single mother at that. Sure, she fits in with her starched dresses, string of pearls, and floral aprons. Then there are the hushed and mystical consultations with neighborhood women in distress. The unsavory, mysterious plants in the flower beds. The divined warning to steer clear of a boyfriend whose fate is certainly doomed. But as the daughter of this bewitching homemaker comes of age and her mother’s claims become more and more outlandish, she begins to question everything she once took for granted.</p>";

Participation is mandatory.</b></p> <p>Through clever usage of construction techniques as well as ham-fisted applications of force, Carl survived being reborn as a shadow dragon inside the Scoured Mountain. The future is looking bright for him and his band of trash-tier minions, and they’ll have ample time to decide exactly which kind of society they want to build in this violence-filled world.</p> <p>There’s just one tiny problem. Only one dragon gets to be in charge, and every single other dragon from his clutch survived as well. Now that they’ve gotten to this point, they need to play a little game. The prize is survival and a questionable promotion. Carl's already ahead of the competition because of the questions he gets to ask the mysterious, glowing human trapped inside his domain.</p> <p>He's going to take every advantage he can get.</p>";

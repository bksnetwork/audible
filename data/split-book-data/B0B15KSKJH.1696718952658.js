A thunderous new vocabulary for answering.</b></p> <p>Artorian wakes on a brand-new planet, refreshed and ready to make some mischief now that he’s back in Cal’s soul space!

Being awake has its upsides, but there are a few...concerns.</p> <p>Cal, even unconscious, is pushing the boundaries of the double-S ranks. With oaths and promises in peril, should he breach that rank before letting people live their lives, Artorian will hustle and bustle to lay the groundwork for mass-decanting. Surely nothing will go wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>Artorian must learn how to be a Mage again and find his legs. There’s more running to do.</p>";

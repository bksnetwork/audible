window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>My life was ordinary, but never boring. That is, until a colossal tower landed smack-dab in the middle of the city.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>What should have followed was mass panic and hysteria, but I never got to that part. Why? Simple. I was taken along with 99,999 other people from Earth and dropped onto an unknown world.</p> <p>Strange beings appeared before usâ€”floating, featureless figures that call themselves demi-gods. They ruled this place, this fantastical world called Gaea. The reason why they took us? Not so simple. We'd supposedly been selected to show that Earth was worth saving from an upcoming cataclysmic event. So, no pressure there.</p> <p>Gaea is a world entirely controlled by the System, a sarcastic and level-hungry intelligence that granted everyone magical powers, strange classes based on personality or luck, monsters to fight and even loot. It forces us to compete in \"events\", but no one can really tell us what the endgame is. Climbing the tower and finding out exactly what Gaea is, who created it, and why, could bring us closer to the truth behind our abduction and the fate of our world.</p> <p><b>My name is Devin Cain. Join me as I wield Muramasa, a cursed katana that hungers for blood and souls, and a class created to curse players and monsters to death. What can go wrong?</b></p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Small town reporter Mia Durante finds herself having brunch with the President of the United States on the day civilization comes to an end.</b></p> <p>An electromagnetic pulse blinds the U.S. Cars crash. Planes fall. Chaos reigns. Power is restored within minutes, but it’s already too late. Russian nukes are falling. U.S. allies around the world are already wiped out. The United States will cease to exist inside of five minutes.</p> <p>After giving the order to launch a full-scale retaliation–dooming the planet–the president, his staff, Secret Service and those lucky enough to be visiting the White House, are whisked below ground, where they board several Earth Escape Pods. As the EEPs launch into Earth orbit, missiles descend.</p> <p>Less than forty survive the end of the world. When they return, they’re greeted by survivors of a different sort. The bloodbath that follows leaves Durante and nine other survivors on the run. They find themselves fighting for survival in a world in which only torment remains and where death is the only escape.</p> <p><i>Torment </i>is award-winning author Jeremy Robinson’s first pulse-pounding horror novel&nbsp;(originally penned under his Jeremy Bishop pseudonym). It's a horrific tale of post-apocalyptic terror that is one part zombie story and one part Dante’s Inferno. The story asks hard questions and generates strong emotions in everyone who listens to it—anger, excitement, and most of all: fear. This book asks the question that everyone is afraid to answer:&nbsp;are you ready?</p>";

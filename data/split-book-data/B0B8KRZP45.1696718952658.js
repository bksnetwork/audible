window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>To save mankind...they must raise the gods.</b></p> <p>Several months after his neighborhood was cloaked in darkness and invaded by the demon-like denizens of a hellish world, life has returned to normal for Miah Gray, a.k.a. Laser Chicken. No longer burdened by PTSD, he is free to enjoy his family and to help pick up the pieces of a pillaged world.</p> <p>At night, he trains with his eight-year-old companion, Bree, a.k.a. Demon Dog, and their neighbors Henry and Sarah, the god-like descendants of Helen of Sparta and the mythological Zeus.</p> <p>All is calm...until new neighbors move in across the street and shatter the peace. Jonas, a.k.a. Mind Bullet, a telekinetic assassin, and his artificial intelligence, Bubbles, are pursued by strange and powerful enemies. The neighborhood is rocked by sudden violence, but the unlikely heroes band together to save the residents once more.</p> <p>However, their victory is short-lived when it’s interrupted by the appearance of a superhuman figure who has been influencing their lives for years—Linda, a.k.a. Zeus.</p> <p>In classic mythology fashion, Zeus, supreme god of Olympus, sends them on an urgent quest: descend into the underworld; travel through the realm between worlds, <i>Khaos</i>; face whatever trials await; find the gate to Tartarus; and summon the gods and Titans residing there to war. A grave evil is coming, and only Earth’s oldest and most powerful heroes can stop it.</p> <p><b>With his unique brand of madness, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;and #1 Audible bestseller Jeremy Robinson descends into the underworld and puts a new spin on Greek mythology. Laying the final puzzle piece for the Infinite Timeline,</b><b><i> Khaos</i></b><b> is an epic crossover novel that is equal parts character, myth, humor, and poetic action.</b></p>";

Actually, I've been informed that my name is a pronoun. But that part doesn't matter at the moment.</p> <p>Somehow, we did it. Clovis and I survived the first floor of the tower. We were nearly killed in the process, yet we were able to class, make a few enemies, learn more about the mechanics of Genera, and have a hell of a time in doing it.</p> <p>The only problem is, we need a strategy. We need to get better and improve our stats. The first floor was tough. But the second floor of the tower looks to be twice as difficult....</p> <p>Genera has turned against us. The floor challenges are harder and harder as we go. From taming dragons to fighting the elven undead and everything in between. I mean everything. This fantasy world is relentless. It's complex and unpredictable. But it is also fun.</p> <p>An axe in each hand, and nowhere to go but up, Genera is my chance to make something unique of my life.</p> <p>Yet with every new challenge, the risk of instant death is real. This isn't a VRMMORPG. This is my real life, one that could end with just one false move or poor decision....</p> <p><b>About the series:</b></p> <p><i>Tokens and Towers</i> is from Amazon best seller Harmon Cooper, author of <i>Monster Hunt NYC</i> and <i>The Feedback Loop</i>. This is Harmon's <i>seventh </i>LitRPG series, one jam-packed with genre Easter eggs, fantasy tropes turned upside down, a ton of heart, and a <i>John Wick</i>'s worth of action.</p>";

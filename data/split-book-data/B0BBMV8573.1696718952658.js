Providence is a profitable global industry. </b></p> <p>For Loki, three hundred years is a long time to be trapped in divinity’s answer to crap customer service, especially when the PR machine makes him out to be the bad guy. But that’s what happens when you lose a war.&nbsp;</p> <p>All he has to do to regain his godly powers is avoid the seers, outwit the executives, and win a rematch against public perception. Easy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Too bad he's not the only one playing at espionage. When his chief executive’s a narcissistic authoritarian and the combined might of the divine powers is ignoring humanity’s problems, he’s bound to aggravate some people—gods and mortals alike.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mythology, blasphemy, and rebellion combine in this sacrilegious corporate fantasy series.&nbsp;</p>";

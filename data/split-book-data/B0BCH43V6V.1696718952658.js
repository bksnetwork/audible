All he cares about is finding a place where he can escape the misery of Earth and start over.</p> <p>Join Alexander as he risks it all by downloading his intelligence into a body made from the best stolen technology and bio-enhancements Earth has to offer and takes the plunge through a portal to another world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only this new world isn't full of the idyllic adventures and fantasy roleplaying he had hoped to find.

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ruwen survived Legion’s Fifth Vault with devastating consequences. His escape flung him far from home, severing his connection to Uru. Even his Void Band, with its link to the Black Pyramid, no longer works. Isolated, with no obvious path back, he must learn new skills or die here.</p> <p>For the first time, Ruwen can access his Core without worrying about discovery, and the work started in the Spirit Realm creating spells can finally continue. But that alone will not be enough, and he carefully explores the power of the mysterious Architect Role passed to him by the Goddess Uru.</p> <p>The solitude also provides Ruwen time to perfect his Bamboo Viper Steps and investigate the hidden layers the forms contain. Pushing himself physically, mentally, and spiritually momentarily lets him forget his grim existence.</p> <p>But as the seclusion persists, Overlord, the mental construct given life by the trap Rami triggered at Malth’s Library, continues to evolve, altering Ruwen’s mind, and causing Ruwen to doubt his sanity.</p> <p>Underlying the isolation, loneliness, and harsh conditions lives the fear that one mistake will result in permanent death.</p> <p>But if Ruwen doesn’t overcome that fear, and push himself to his limits, he will never leave this place. And the consequences to himself, his friends, and the Universe will be nothing short of catastrophic.</p>";

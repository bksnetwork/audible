window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The spooky conclusion to the Holiday Dungeon Core series!</b><br> <br> Elmer Robbins has survived thousands of Adventurers delving through his dungeon, but the holiday-obsessed Dungeon Core is in danger. The threat doesn’t stem from some powerful Adventurer or world-ending crisis set to destroy his Core, but from his own success. With a limitation set upon him from the Gods and Goddesses of his new world, he soon hits a wall in his development that could end up destroying him because of an overabundance of Life Force he is forced to absorb from slain Adventurers in his dungeon.<br> <br> With a choice between slowly succumbing to his destruction by doing nothing, which would prolong his life, or going out in a blaze of glory by creating another holiday-themed section to his dungeon and inviting the permanent death of his soul all that much faster, the decision was easy. With new Halloween-based rooms, he can finally decorate for one of his favorite holidays, and this new section is well-suited the environs of a dungeon. <br> <br> Will the Adventurers appreciate his new fear-filled dungeon areas filled with pumpkins, skeletons, ghosts, vampires, and even trick-or-treating before the inevitable destruction meets his Core? Or will there be a light at the end of the tunnel, saving both Elmer and his trapped wife’s soul from utter annihilation?<br> <br> Find out now in the conclusion to the Holiday Dungeon Core series, <i>Halloween Core</i>!<br> <br> Halloween Core<i> is a short, 42k-word novella set in a unique universe that contains LitRPG and Dungeon Core elements such as stats and character progression. Contains no foul language, explicit sexual content, or harems.</i></p>";

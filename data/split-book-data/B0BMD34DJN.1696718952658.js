Then he and his shipmates found themselves unwillingly transplanted to Fanwath, where magic is real, danger abounds, and the almighty “System” grants levels, points, and powers based on one’s individual triumphs.</p> <p>Now, Morgan and his native Ardeni mate, Issa, have founded a growing colony for both their peoples, and they’re able to draw ever more tribes and lifeforms—even some of their former Urghat enemies—into trade and warfare alliances. But though their colony is a beacon of freedom, Morgan finds himself wanting more: more skills, more strength, more knowledge of Fanwath. So, he and Issa set out for unknown lands in search of adventure and advancement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Fae have taken an interest in the human settlement and work to recruit Bronwyn Tallow to their cause, and Olivia Bennet enters Fainhallow Academy in order to hone her magical talents. But as Morgan, Bronwyn, and Olivia’s abilities grow, so do the threats they face, and they’ll soon discover some ambitions come at a dreadful cost—and even good intentions can lead to unexpected evil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the LitRPG adventure series from the author of Royal Road hit Victor of Tucson—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";

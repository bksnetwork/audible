After all, how heroic can one be when your children are left without you? Convinced that they need to find their own paths forward and forge their own legends if they're to ascend the throne one day, the children set off to find themselves.</p> <p>It doesn’t take long at all for them to be deeply entangled in a web of Brindollan Affairs.</p>";

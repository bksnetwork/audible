Monster hunting class is in session.</b></p> <p>For as long as he can remember, Liam Hunter has been on the road hunting monsters with his family. But after meeting the Davis family, everything he’s ever known about monsters has been destroyed as well as the walls around his heart. Can Liam find out who or what is killing teachers in Falkville Falls before the next murder, or will this vicious cycle of deaths have no end?</p> <p>Meanwhile, with only their father to care for them, Olivia Davis has always felt like a mother figure to her little sister. But after meeting the Hunter family and learning there are real monsters she never knew existed, she no longer thinks she can protect her family alone. Now she’ll have to join forces with the one boy who has crawled under her skin and into her heart to take down a monster that’s too close to home. That’s if her own family doesn’t stand in her way.</p>";

Yet the System has continued its own methodical advance, meaning Randidly has no time to take the rest he needs.</p> <p>Zone 32 now hosts two Champions; individuals provided by the System who can teach unique Skills to their followers. In the one corner, wreathed in a green light, comes the Wild Rider. Opposite her stands the stark and intimidating Skeleton Knight. The previously isolated populations come together, clustering around these two figures.</p> <p>By the time word reaches Randidly that his friends Ace and Sydney yet live, a harsh truth is revealed: in the end, there can only be one Champion of Zone 32.</p> <p>On the horizon, an even larger decision looms. In order to keep ahead of the curve and create a miracle, Randidly can only think of one possibility: to finally obtain a Class of his own. Not from a Village Spirit, but forged with his own hands.</p> <p><i>This is book four of the hit LitRPG fantasy series with over 50 Million views on Royal Road.</i></p>";

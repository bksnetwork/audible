Beatrix–a white-scaled dragon–is hell-bent on stirring chaos within the tightly-knit guild. She twists together their pasts and pits everyone against one another. Even the specialized training endured on their journey proves not to be enough. Time is ticking away…before the enemy links a new world to Strathmar, and unleashes a reign of diabolical beasts upon both.</p> <p>With no other choice, Aegis does everything in his power to push through each layer, clinging desperately to his sanity on every turn to stop the gate from opening and ending all worlds.</p> <p>Will he be able to emerge with his friends intact? Or will he fail, losing even more control to those who want to tear Strathmar apart?</p>";

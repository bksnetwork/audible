window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Stack your Deck. Climb the Gaia Tower. Defeat its Guardians.</b></p> <p>Almost half a century has passed since prison ships en route to Australia discovered the mysterious Tower rising out of the Indian Ocean, known as Gaia. Monarchies, republics, and trading giants came together to build a city around it and contain the monsters spilling out of the rune-covered structure.</p> <p>The few that dared enter and climb it learned the magic of Gaia's runic cards.</p> <p>Now, most people enter the tower seeking fame, fortune, or power. Not Diya Sen. He climbs hoping to find clues about his missing brother and to solve Gaia's mysteries. However, the warring noble houses stand in his way.</p> <p>His mission won't be easy. Many sources of power are outside his reach as an ordinary man. But if the direct approach doesn't help Diya achieve his goals, perhaps the talents of a Spell Thief will.</p> <p><b>Don't miss the start of the Tower of Cards series from best seller J Pal. This is progression fantasy utilizing a runic-card-based magic system with tons of customization. Perfect for fans of </b><b><i>All the Skills </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Towers of Heaven</i></b><b>, as well as games such as </b><b><i>Slay the Spire</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Hearthstone</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Gwent</i></b><b>.</b></p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hello stranger, my name is Tal, and I’m <i>not </i>an adventurer—those people are crazy. I’m just a sorcerer who is masquerading as a wizard. Oh, and I’m searching for answers about my parents’ mysterious deaths. Also monsters and other foes seem to show up wherever I go.</p> <p>All right, I see it.</p> <p>My new traveling companions <i>are</i> seasoned adventurers and are teaching me their ways—or at least they were before something happened to Time.</p> <p>The same day is repeating itself over and over, and I’m the only one aware of the resets. If I ever want to get past this day—and the horrific hangover it always starts with—I’ll need to find a way out by myself.</p> <p>It turns out there are mysteries aplenty to unravel in this remote forest town of Crossroads, where I’m living the same day over and over. But my most vital resource might already be in my possession. My previously useless Spellbook is starting to exhibit some very strange abilities, and they could be just what I need in my quest to escape this temporal prison.</p> <p>This is my story. My diary of sorts. Don’t judge too harshly, I had a rough day.</p>";

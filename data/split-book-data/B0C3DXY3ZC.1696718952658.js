window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Romance, drudgery, and dungeons collide in the second book of this inventive progression-fantasy series blending office humor and RPGs.</b></p> <p>Ever since James Lyle found an alternate dimension hidden in the stairwell of his workplace, things have been, well, weird. For one thing, when he’s not working the night shift, he’s battling killer mail carts and ravenous swarms of sticky notes. For another, he’s dealing with some very complex and intense emotions for several of his friends. Meanwhile, his parents have offloaded his younger sister on him, a minor annoyance in the grand scheme of things but it certainly doesn’t help.</p> <p>As if all this weren’t enough, James’s voyages into the dungeon world seem to be having a strange effect on the world in which he actually lives. His memories are disappearing, changing—to the point where people he knows should exist somehow seem to have been wiped from reality. Logic would say he and his questing mates should maybe, I don’t know, stop heading into the eerie maze of seemingly endless cubicles and dubiously useful skill orbs? But if James is going to set his plane of existence right, he’ll need to defeat the corporate darkness he’s uncovered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p>Blending slice of life with snarky working-class humor, brilliant role-playing mechanics, and irresistible world-building, <i>The Daily Grind 2</i> is a pitch-perfect continuation of an epic series, guaranteed to charm anyone who’s ever dealt with the nine-to-five slog.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than four million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";

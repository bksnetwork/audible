window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Greg and Julian need to make a choice—die in the tornado that’s sucked them up in their van, or agree to hunt monsters in a world full of magic and levels and, oh yeah…monsters.</p> <p>The two frat bros may be master ghost hunters to their podcast listeners, but they never expected their antics to be taken seriously by a goddess in another dimension. And since when are ghosts the same as monsters?</p> <p>Awkward.</p> <p>But when the other option is certain death, it seems like it’s worth giving it the old college try.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Grim Guys is danger and adventure and buddy comedy at its best. Go deeper into the world of Vuldranni—and into an entirely different empire—in the latest series from Eric Ugland.</p>";

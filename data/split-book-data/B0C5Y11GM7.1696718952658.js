window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Don't be distracted. Trust the Quest. Kill your target.</b></p> <p>Ten years ago, the world changed. The System brought dungeons and monsters to earth. Billions were lost.</p> <p>While most try to rebuild, Claire chooses to take revenge on the people who took advantage of orphans in the chaosâ€”100 names, 100 targets.</p> <p>In this often brutal story about a world in chaos, Claire will kill every target on her list. No matter what it takes.</p> <p><i>Apocalypse Assassin</i> takes the listener through an alternate world where people delve into dungeons to grow stronger, Skills bring magic to life, and the world rebuilds.</p> <p>All while Claire kills anyone whose name appears on her list.</p> <p><b>About the series:</b> System Orphans is set in a post-apocalypse fantasy and LitRPG world where each story will follow a different orphan in their altered environment. Claire's story, which will be written over at least three books, is the first in this elegant yet brutal fantasy. With magic, dungeons, and twists you didn't see coming, you're likely to love, or love to hate, this killer teenager.</p> <p>Claire's story is inspired by movies like <i>Red Sparrow</i> and <i>John Wick</i>, while drawing inspiration from LitRPGs such as System Apocalypse by Tao Wong and Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman.</p> <p>The series is recommended for young adults and older, since it includes excessive language, brutal fights, and a great deal of death. The series will have no sexual or sexualized content.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Surviving a world based on a System can be a nonstop struggle, rife with battle, blood, and badassery—now imagine surviving when you </b><b><i>are</i></b><b> the System&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></p> <p>Parker Wu’s life was cut short after a tragic encounter with a very large truck. But when one existence ended, another far more bizarre one began. Reincarnated and transported to the Continent—a world of swords and sorcery in which an all-powerful being known as the Eternal King reigns supreme—Parker is no longer a corporeal being. It seems the Continent has other plans for the late Earthling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p>As it turns out, Parker is now a System, a <i>non-player</i> entity whose purpose is to help a <i>player</i> succeed. Parker’s been specially created to guide and try to protect a fellow human: the Godkiller Jerome Smith. It’s Jerome’s fate to find, fight, and destroy the Eternal King. Soon, the pair find themselves growing stronger (if not always smarter) and gathering a few allies along the way.</p> <p>But as they progress, the dangers only get more lethal, and unfortunately, Jerome’s own brash personality may be his undoing. Unless Parker can get the Godkiller to stop treating everything like a game&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p><b>The hit LitRPG adventure—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>So... back for more?</b></p> <p>Well, I can't say I'm surprised. Going from a no-good Neet to a magician with a magic book doesn't happen to everyone. And I doubt it'll happen to you, but that doesn't mean you can't continue to enjoy this guide, this tale of mine. And I can assure you that things only get more interesting, much to my surprise at the time. More magic, mayhem, and of course, Bob.</p> <p>As usual, life continues to throw jabs at me and even a few uppercuts, sending me spiraling into further insanity and trouble. By now, I'm getting used to it, and the push forward continues. As my training with Bob continues, and my relationships develop, those from near and afar make their moves. Pieces on the chessboard all looking for a checkmate, and whether I like it or not, I'll find myself at the center. Adversity, adventure, and more action than I would have liked at the time. Prepare to learn more about how I, a former full-time Neet, became a god.</p>";

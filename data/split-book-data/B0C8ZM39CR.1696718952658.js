The experience left him shaken–but luckily, he now has friends to lean on.</p> <p>Speaking of DCO, while James might feel like the main character at times, the game itself, and the developers behind it, think otherwise. During his stint as a pawn helping bring down the dangerous hacker group, a lot of upgrades to DCO were implemented without him. Now, James is diving headfirst into all of it!&nbsp;</p> <p>New floors, new levels, and so much more, including a rematch against a certain winged lizard cult that Rue, ahem, the White Beast of Chaos, is chomping at the bit to take part in.</p> <p>James is back where he is supposed to be—running his dungeon, hanging out with Rue, and sipping digitally rendered cocktails served by cybernetic penguins. He’s trying to forget his own unpleasant memories–and he's not the only one.&nbsp;</p> <p>But DCO is full of distractions–and one new game mode, in particular, is set to keep James occupied for quite a while. In more ways than he could ever imagine....</p> <p>Now, for the first time since its debut, James can finally run the dungeon himself.</p>";

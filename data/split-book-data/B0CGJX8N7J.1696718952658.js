And a conglomerate angered...</b></p> <p>After unwittingly becoming the CEO of the growing Silken Sands Affiliate, Tyson finds himself in an increasingly dangerous Arizonan desert, the protector of a growing community of Nu-Earth humans faced with the very real possibility of total corporate annihilation.</p> <p>Dearth wants their land, and they will not take no for an answer. But behind Tyson stand a growing band of capable administrators and heroes, and a community of people who believe in him. He is their leader. They trust in him, even if he doesn't trust in himself.</p> <p>Powerful multiversal forces are at play. Market upsets, brilliant purchases, and the invisible hand slide, slap, and strangle as the campaign for Arizona state rages, and Silken Sands digs in for a decisive battle.</p> <p>This story features an amalgamation of Amazon, Walmart, every service fee, sales algorithm, membership perk, advertising jingo, Microsoft mascot, and insane discount that you have ever experienced in your life coupled with the madness of the multiverse, a dash of invisible hand monopolism, feudalism, straight-up cronyism, and LOTS of profanity. There is fantasy violence, base-building, tons of market loot, monsters, a dungeon, affiliate and credit levels, and progression.</p> <p><i>BuyMort: Rise of the Window Puncher</i> completes the How I Became the Accidental Warlord of Arizona story arc, but the Shopocalypse Saga will continue.</p>";
